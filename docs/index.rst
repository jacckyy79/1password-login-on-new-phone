Why Logging Into 1Password on a New Phone is Important
=======================================================

When switching to a new phone, it's critical to restore access to your password vault. 1Password uses a security model that requires:

- A **Master Password**

This ensures that even if someone has your phone, they can’t access your sensitive data without all three.

Prerequisites

Before beginning the login process on a new phone, make sure you have:

- Your **1Password account email address**
- Your **Secret Key** (found in your Emergency Kit)
- Your **Master Password**
- Your **Authenticator App** (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) if 2FA is enabled

Having these items ready will make the login smooth and secure.
